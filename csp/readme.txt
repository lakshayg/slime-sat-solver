Sugar is a SAT-based Constraint Solver. Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is encoded to a Boolean CNF formula, and it is solved by an external SAT solver. Sugar also can solve Constraint Optimization Problems (COP) and Max-CSP. Sugar is an award winning solver of global constraint categories at the International CSP Solver Competitions in 2008 and 2009, and of four categories at the 2008 International Max-CSP Solver Competition.
